Cobbling an Interpreter, June 24-28, 2024
=========================================

Our goal: Implement an interpreter in Rust from the first part of
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

Setup
-----

First, you should clone and make your own branch of the repo.

```
bash $ git clone https://github.com/dabeaz-course/rust_2024_06
bash $ cd rust_2024_06
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
bash $ git push -u origin yourname
```

For the remainder of the week, you should do all of the work in your
dedicated branch of the repository.  Moreover, I strongly encourage
you to commit and push the code in your branch throughout the
course. For example:

```
bash $ git commit -m "Solved some problem"
bash $ git push
```

I strongly encourage people to look at other branches, copy code, and make
comments.   I will be working from the "dabeaz" branch.

Real-time Chat
--------------

The course uses Zoom chat and Github discussions.  Github discussions
is a better option for topics involving code examples.

Zoom Meeting Link
-----------------

The live course is conducted via Zoom.  The official course hours are
09:30-16:30 US CDT/CHICAGO (UTC-05:00).
