Cobbling an Interpreter, June 24-28, 2024
=========================================

Our goal: Implement an interpreter in Rust from the first part of
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

Some back-story: I've been thinking about the possibility of offering
a "Programming Languages" course for some time.  This course is a bit
of an experiment into how it might work--by trying to implement a simple
programming language using one of the most modern programming languages
around.   There should be more than enough to talk about.

Setup
-----

First, you should clone and make your own branch of the repo.

```
bash $ git clone https://github.com/dabeaz-course/rust_2024_06
bash $ cd rust_2024_06
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
bash $ git push -u origin yourname
```

For the remainder of the week, you should do all of the work in your
dedicated branch of the repository.  Moreover, I strongly encourage
you to commit and push the code in your branch throughout the
course. For example:

```
bash $ git commit -m "Solved some problem"
bash $ git push
```

I would encourage you to look at other branches, copy code, and make
comments.   I will be working from the "dabeaz" branch.

Real-time Chat
--------------

The course uses Zoom chat and Github discussions.  [Github discussions](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/rust_2024_06/discussions)
is a better option for topics involving code examples.

I would also encourage you to make a brief introduction on [here](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/rust_2024_06/discussions/1).

Zoom Meeting Link
-----------------

The live course is conducted via Zoom.  The official course hours are
09:30-16:30 US CDT/CHICAGO (UTC-05:00).
